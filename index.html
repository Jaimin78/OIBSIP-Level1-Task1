            <p class="sectionTag text-big center">Paris , Franch</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Paris is monumental, both due to its size but also its wealth of
                architectural heritage! The symbol of the capital city, and doubtless its best-known monument, is the
                unique Eiffel Tower, the "Iron Lady" that offers visitors an unsurpassed view. Close by is the equally
                iconic Arc de Triomphe. This historical landmark dazzles onlookers on summer days, when the sun sets
                through the huge arch. Notre Dame Cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic architecture, is another
                magnificent and unmissable sight, where you can admire sculptures, the nave, towers and even the crypt!
                Just as evocative, the Sacré-Cœur Basilica has been the source of inspiration for writers and
                film-makers. It houses the largest mosaic in France and boasts an incredible panoramic view over the
                city from the top of the Montmartre district! Paris is also a city of iconic squares, including the
                Place de la Concorde with its two fountains, rostral columns and the incredible Luxor Obelisk, the Place
                de la Bastille, with its famous July Column commemorating the revolution and its very modern Paris
                National Opera and the Place de l'Opéra, featuring the magnificent Opéra Garnier.
